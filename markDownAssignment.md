I believe that dogs are infact the top animal. I am partial to this placement as I was raised around dogs and have a dog myself but here is why dogs are top tier

+ They are so pure and happy to be alive
+ Fluffy
+ Energetic but also will cuddle when tired which is adorable
+ Variety in breeds  

    ##### _Here are my top 4 dog breeds_
        
    * Pitbulls
    * Dobermans
    * Beagles
    * Golden Retrievers  

+ If emotionally intelligent, will recognize emotions and comfort their humans
+ Can smell issues going on in the body like low blood sugar, cancer, organ failures, etc..

Dogs are easily an S tier animal for their friendliness alone

These long neck bois have always been my go to dino. Just look at how cool their long neck is!  
According to [activewild](https://www.activewild.com/brachiosaurus-facts-pictures-information/)
> With its long neck extended, Brachiosaurus would have been around 12-16 meters (40-50ft) tall.
###### ~~Talk about comically oversized spoon.~~

They also weighed a lot. Like a ton... a skele**ton**. More specifically between 33 and 66 short tons.
